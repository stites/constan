# Bishop's Constructive Analysis in Agda
This repo is home to the undergraduate honours project of Zach Murray at Dalhousie University and its extensions by other contributors.

The undergraduate thesis on this project is available on the arXiv at https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.08354.

The version of the repository described in the thesis is at commit 5cd6d3d:
